# Data Visualization Interpretation

### Data Visualization Caveats

Even though this is a very powerful visualization, we should note some limitations to the data:

* We shaded values based on the number of COVID-19 cases per 1,000 residents to standardize the comparisons between counties, however, this is based on the reported numbers from each county. Each county and city have different protocols and resources for testing, which means that part of our visualization might indicate a county's capacity to test for COVID-19
* These values are the total, cumulative reported confirmed COVID-19 cases, which means that many of the counted patients might have recovered from the virus already. We use this value to represent the overall toll that the virus has taken on a particular geographic region instead of the number of active cases at any given time.  

### Data Interpretation

In looking at the animated choropleth map, it looks like COVID-19 cases originated in counties that have large international airports \(LAX, SFO, IAH, JFK, etc.\) after the first cases in Washington state, and then started spreading inward toward the middle of the United States. We also notice that some counties appear to have zero cases \(light blue geographic areas\) either because there are no cases, because citizens aren't being tested, or because these regions haven't reported anything according to the NYT data set.

**How is this animated data visualization helpful for county and state leadership or business owners in the US? What other data might we want to incorporate into an animated choropleth map to better understand the toll of the novel coronavirus in the United States?**
