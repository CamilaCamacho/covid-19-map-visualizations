# Making Maps to Show Today's Cumulative Confirmed COVID-19 Cases

We'll build on our Python data cleaning and visualization knowledge to first make a heatmap that shows the density of cumulated confirmed COVID-19 cases in each US county on April 14, 2020. 

### Data Sources

We'll use the most recent data upload \([April 14, 2020](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports/04-14-2020.csv)\) from the [JHU CSSE GitHub page](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports) to build this heatmap. 

### Python Packages

We'll use **`pandas`** and **`plotly express`** to build our  density heatmap visualization. These should already be installed in your [business-analytics virtual environment](https://app.gitbook.com/@melanieshimano/s/python-data-analysis/getting-started-with-writing-python-code/anaconda-and-jupyterlab-notebooks/virtual-environments). Make sure to select your virtual environment in the Anaconda homepage before you launch JupyterLab.

### Documentation

All of the data files and code files are available in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jhu-business-analytics/covid-19-map-visualizations).
